#XcodeProjectModifier
## Overview
`XcodeProjectModifier` can assist in automatically adding files and frameworks to your Xcode 4+ project after it is generated by Unity 3D.

###Changes

1) Allow all settings to be optional.

2) Fix system path issue when building Xcode project from Windows.

3) Allow per-file compiler settings.

## Installation
Add all files of the repo to your Unity project Editor Folder.


## Usage
Example modifications are contained in the 'XcodeProjectMods' folder, but please refer to the original/modified repos for more meaningful examples.

To specify per-file compiler flags:

	"files": ["path/filename:-flag"]


`XcodeProjectMods` has been tested with Unity 4.5+ and Xcode 5+.
